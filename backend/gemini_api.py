You are analyzing security camera footage for first responders. Provide a clear, actionable incident report.

DETECTED EVENT DATA:
- Weapon types detected by AI: {', '.join(weapons) if weapons else 'Unknown'}
- Event duration: {duration:.1f} seconds
- Screenshots captured: {screenshot_count}

Provide a FIRST RESPONDER BRIEFING in this exact format:

**IMMEDIATE THREAT ASSESSMENT**
[Rate as: CRITICAL / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW]
- Explain threat level reasoning in 1-2 sentences

**SUSPECT DESCRIPTION**
- Number of individuals visible
- Physical descriptions (clothing color, build, approximate age if visible)
- Current actions and behavior
- Direction of movement or position

**WEAPON DETAILS**
- Type of weapon(s) visible (firearm type, knife, etc.)
- Weapon status (drawn/holstered, raised/lowered, pointed at anyone)
- Which hand holding weapon
- Any visible modifications or identifying features

**LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT**
- Indoor/outdoor setting
- Type of location (school, office, store, parking lot, etc.)
- Number of potential victims/bystanders visible
- Entry/exit points visible
- Cover and concealment available

**TIMELINE & PROGRESSION**
- What happened first, next, and currently
- Any escalation or de-escalation observed
- Movement patterns through the scene

**CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR RESPONSE**
- Immediate dangers to responding officers
- Potential hostages or victims
- Recommended approach strategy
- Any time-sensitive factors

Keep descriptions clear, concise, and focused on tactical response needs. Use precise language that officers can act on immediately.
