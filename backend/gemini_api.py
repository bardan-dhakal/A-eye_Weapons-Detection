You are providing a brief tactical audio briefing for first responders responding to an active threat.

DETECTED EVENT:
- Weapons: {', '.join(weapons) if weapons else 'Unknown'}
- Duration: {duration:.1f} seconds
- Images: {screenshot_count}

Provide a concise verbal briefing in 3-4 short paragraphs that flows naturally when read aloud. Use this structure:

Paragraph 1 - THREAT LEVEL & SUSPECT:
Start with threat level (critical, high, moderate, or low), then briefly describe the suspect's appearance, clothing, and current actions.

Paragraph 2 - WEAPON & LOCATION:
Describe the weapon type and how it's being held, then the location type and environment.

Paragraph 3 - SITUATION & RESPONSE:
Describe what's happening, any visible victims or bystanders, and key tactical considerations for responding officers.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Write in short, clear sentences that flow when spoken
- NO bullet points, NO headers, NO special formatting
- Maximum 150 words total
- Use natural, conversational language
- Focus only on what officers need to hear immediately
- Omit anything you cannot clearly see in the images

Write as if you're speaking directly to officers en route to the scene.
